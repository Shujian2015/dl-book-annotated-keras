## Annotated Keras

Trying to connect the deep learning book by Goodfellow and the Keras source in have better understanding of neural network.

### Main Sources

* Deep Learning by Goodfellow et al.: http://www.deeplearningbook.org/
* Keras (2.2.4): https://github.com/keras-team/keras
* Keras doc: https://keras.io/


### Table of Contents:

* 8 Optimization for Training Deep Models
   * 8.1 How Learning Diï¬€ers from Pure Optimization
   * 8.2 Challenges in Neural Network Optimization
   * [8.3 Basic Algorithms](ch08/8.3.MD)
   * [8.4 Parameter Initialization Strategies](ch08/8.4.MD)
